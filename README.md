Following along with the design brief I want the user to have a very friendly and eco sensible experiance for this I have picked Two fonts Both from the Google Fonts library. Fonts used are Lato and Roboto.

### Colours:

colour insperation has been decided upon with the aid of [Colorinspo](https://colorsinspo.com/color-palettes/search/?sterm=%232d767f)

- #1e6262 - Dark
- #2d767f - Blue
- #b4f1f1 - Light.
- #ecfffb - background

### Images:

All Images used within this site have beenn provided with [Pexels](https://pexels.com) a royalty free website.
all images have been compressed with the use of [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) - images with an opaque overlay have been compressed heavier as the quality of the image isn't as important.

### Wireframes

The basic structure of SEASTAINABILITY was sketched out on paper and then with the use of the software [BALSAMIQ](https://balsamiq.com/). I was able to take the sketches and turn them into a more professional and realistic looking guide.

## Technologies

### Languages used:

- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## Testing:

For testing I viewed the site on multiple devices and browsers and compiled a spreadsheet with all the results. Using the results from the tests I was able to impliment fixes for some of the bugs found.

### Testing Results:

## Deployment

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. Visit [Github](www.github.com).
2. Navigate to the [roomacarthur/seastainability](https://github.com/roomacarthur/seastainability) Repository.

   > git clone git@github.com:roomacarthur/seastainability.git

The code will now be available within the cirectory you created. You can open the code up with the command
