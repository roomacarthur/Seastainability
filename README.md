## Design

### Design Brief:

For SEASTAINABILITY the whole idea is to provide simple and easy to read information on how to become more sustainable to help protect and save our oceans. The overall design principle for the site is to be simple and follow a stlye that has an essence of sustainablity about it, using relative colours and typography. The sites demographic is so vast that the site has to appeal to everyone that views it from young to old and all beliefs. The site will remain neutral but have a simplistic modern feel to it.

### Typography:

Following along with the design brief I want the user to have a very friendly and eco sensible experiance for this I have picked Two fonts Both from the Google Fonts library. Fonts used are [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto).

### Colours:

To keep the colours inline with the design brief and with the help of [Colorinspo](https://colorsinspo.com/color-palettes/search/?sterm=%232d767f) I have decided to go with the netural colours listed below.

- #1e6262 - Dark
- #2d767f - Blue
- #b4f1f1 - Light.
- #ecfffb - background

### Images:

All Images used within this site have beenn provided with [Pexels](https://pexels.com) a royalty free website.
all images have been compressed with the use of [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) - images with an opaque overlay have been compressed heavier as the quality of the image isn't as important.
The Favicon used for the site was taken from [Favicon.cc](https://www.favicon.cc/?action=icon&file_id=690331)

### Content:

- Do your part page content was taken from [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/10-things-you-can-do-to-save-the-ocean)
- Page content is static and won't change, when desiging the layout of pages this was taken into consideration. Page content can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18xpv4xm6ch3qhcZeHQ55RjGOaYjjJ777VEZF4EyxMzs/edit?usp=sharing)

### Wireframes:

The basic structure of SEASTAINABILITY was sketched out on paper and then with the use of the software [BALSAMIQ](https://balsamiq.com/). I was able to take the sketches and turn them into a more professional and realistic looking guide.

For testing I viewed the site on multiple devices and browsers and compiled a spreadsheet with all the results. Using the results from the tests I was able to impliment fixes for some of the bugs found.

### Testing Results:

### Bugs & Fixes:

- ~~On mobile View the Border top for nav items doesn't fit 100% of screen width.~~ _fixed_
