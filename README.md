### Design Brief:

### Typography:

      Following along with the design brief I want the user to have a very friendly and eco sensible experiance for this I have picked Two fonts Both from the Google Fonts library. Fonts used are Lato and Roboto.

### Colours:

colour insperation has been decided upon with the aid of [Colorinspo](https://colorinspo.com)
#1e6262 - Dark
#2d767f - Blue
#b4f1f1 - Light.
#ecfffb - background

### Images:

All Images used within this site have beenn provided with [Pexels](https://pexels.com) a royalty free website.
all images have been compressed with the use of [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) - images with an opaque overlay have been compressed heavier as the quality of the image isn't as important.
