          <h3>RUBBISH</h3>
          <hr class="content-hr" />
          <p>
            According to the United Nations, at least 800 species are affected
            by marine debris and around 80% of that debris is thought to be
            plastic. An estimated 13,000,000 metric tons of plastic find their
            way into our oceans every year this is about the same as one rubbish
            truck load being dumped into the ocean every minute. Most plastics
            can take centuries to decompose but some break down into
            microplastics quickly, these microplastics end up in the seafood we
            eat, the plastic cycle goes full circle so not only does it affect
            the fish it affects us also. Making more sustainable choices on the
            products we buy and how we dispose of them can go a long way in
            protecting marine life and our oceans.

          <h3>SUNSCREEN</h3>
          <hr class="content-hr" />
          <p>
            We all know wearing sunscreen is a really important part of life in
            protecting our skin when in sunny climates but most people don’t
            know how harmful sunscreen can be for our oceans especially coral
            reefs. Coral reefs are one of the most important ecosystems in our
            oceans they are home to over a quarter of all known marine species.
            The harmful chemicals we can find in most sunscreen are; oxybenzone,
            octinoxate, and octocrylene. When picking sunscreen consumers should
            check for the ‘reef safe’ label.

          <h3>OVERFISHING</h3>
          <hr class="content-hr" />
          <p>
            Regarded to some as the biggest threat our oceans face, overfishing
            is when commercial fishing is so intense the breeding cycle of
            marine life is brought to a standstill. Overfishing has become so
            dominant because of the increase in money made from the billions of
            people who rely on fish as a source of protein. If people make a
            more judged approach to what seafood they purchase from the shops
            like line-caught and sustainable sources this can help fight back
            against all the harm the giant fishing corporations are causing.
            There needs to be an emphasis on better catch management systems
            from most commercial fisheries.

          <h3>GLOBAL WARMING</h3>
          <hr class="content-hr" />
          <p>
            Our oceans are seriously threatened by global warming and this could
            have a grave effect on the human population, it’s estimated that by
            2030 sea surface temperatures will rise by 0.6-0.9ºC in the southern
            Tasman Sea just off the northwest shelf of western Australia and
            0.3-0.6ºC elsewhere. With this drastic rise in temperatures, our
            oceans face increased acidification and this will have a detrimental
            effect on marine life. Being more conscious of how we commit to
            changes in our life to lower our carbon footprint is so important,
            from driving less, picking renewable energy sources for our homes,
            and purchasing goods from companies that offset their carbon
            footprint can all go a long way in combating global warming.
